# WireBootstrap for Angular
WireBootstrap for Angular features an Angular Component that allows any WireBootstrap component to be used inside the Angular framework.  With this component, there is no need for WireBootstrap component authors to create a separate Angular version of their component.  

The solution also contains a sample project that illustrates how to use WireBootstrap in Angular applications.  This includes setting up access to data services using WireBootstrap data structures as well as the different ways in which the WireBootstrap Angular Component can be used with these data services.
